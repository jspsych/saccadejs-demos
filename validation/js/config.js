   *
   * 1.0.0  the first Prolific pilot (file names without a version).
   * 1.1.0  MediaPipe set up before the warm-up, so `warmup_fps` no longer reads 0 on slow
   *        machines; the camera's own frame rate recorded as `camera_fps`; the inline-encoder
   *        limit a share of one camera frame, not a flat 30 ms; per-frame image quality of the
   *        eye strip (`eye_image_stats`) and the camera's settings (`camera_settings`).
   * 1.3.0  Strided mode is only ever forced now: on integrated graphics it halved the camera
   *        loop and delayed key presses. Too slow for inline, WebGPU machines use the CPU
   *        worker again, now a pool of single-threaded workers (up to 4) each encoding its own
   *        frames, with ONNX Runtime served from lib/ort/. camera_fps measured over wall-clock
   *        time. Served from cogsciresearch.vassar.edu, which sends the COOP/COEP headers.
   * 1.2.0  "strided" encoder mode: on WebGPU too slow for every frame, the encoder stays on
   *        the GPU and embeds whichever frames it has time for, instead of moving to the CPU
   *        worker, and encodes the rest in the downtime (block breaks, the end questions, the
   *        "finishing up" screen). The worker is now only for machines without WebGPU.
   * 1.3.1  The CPU worker pool has no per-station budget and no fixation-only rule: every
   *        frame is queued, the settle included, so saccade.js's saccade latency can be
   *        measured on deferred sessions too. Frames the pool never reaches are saved as eye
   *        crops, up to `encoder.max_crops_saved`, thinned evenly past it.
   * 1.3.2  Fewer CPU workers: the cores minus three (was two), and one on 4 GB or less (was
   *        two). Two workers on 4-core machines halved the recorder's frame rate. The wait
   *        at the end is 20 s (was 45 s).
   * 1.3.3  Practice repeats until a round has every color change caught (at most
   *        `design.practice_max_rounds`, then a screen-out), and the instructions show the
   *        target with and without the orange dot. Practice rows carry `practice_round`.
   * 1.4.0  The version the main data collection runs on. At most 3 CPU workers (was 4), and
   *        the welcome screen says that small images of the eye region may be saved.
   * 1.4.1  Saving only: a retried upload refused as FILE_EXISTS counts as saved (the first
   *        attempt was stored). Nothing recorded changes.
