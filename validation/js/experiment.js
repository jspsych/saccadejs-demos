   * question about a participant's machine: could saccade.js have tracked them in real time,
   * and at what rate? `saccade-performance` is saccade.js's own answer — it runs the real
   * tracker, with the real model, on this camera, and reports the frame rate it achieved.
   *
   * Two reasons not to substitute the recorder's own rate for this. The recorder does strictly
   * more work per frame (it also cuts WebGazer's patches), so it runs slower than live
   * tracking would; and on a machine without WebGPU it moves the encoder to a worker, which
   * live tracking cannot do. Both numbers are recorded, and the difference between them is the
   * price of carrying the second tracker.
   *
   * Placed before the fifteen-second timing measurement so that an exclusion rule, if one is
   * ever added through `inclusion_function`, fires before the participant has spent that time.
   * There is no rule here: the whole point of the deferred encoder is to keep slow machines in
